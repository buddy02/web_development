    <p>Bengaluru, also spelled Bengalooru, formerly Bangalore, city, capital (since 1830) of Karnataka state, southern
        India. Bengaluru is one of India’s largest cities. It lies 3,113 feet (949 metres) above sea level, atop an
        east-west ridge in the Karnataka Plateau in the southeastern part of the state, at a cultural meeting point of
        the Kannada-, Telugu-, and Tamil-speaking peoples. Pop. (2001) city, 4,301,326; urban agglom., 5,701,446; (2011)
        city, 8,443,675; urban agglom., 8,520,435.</p>
    <p>The city’s nucleus was a settlement around a mud fort, built in 1537 by a local chief, Kempe Gowda. The fort was
        reconstructed of stone in 1761. Bangalore was the headquarters of the British administration from 1831 to 1881,
        when the raja was restored. However, Britain retained an administrative and military presence in the city until
        Indian independence in 1947. Bangalore subsequently became the capital of the new state of Mysore and remained
        the capital during the reorganization of states in 1956; Mysore was renamed Karnataka in 1973.
